# 591-IoT-project

## Introduction
The project work is targeted at giving students opportunity to obtain better knowledge and familiarity with sensing and IoT systems. We are going to build a self-service store by using Raspberry Pi, RFID sensor and RFID tags. 

There are several assumption in our project. First of all, we assume each customer have a FRID tag which represent their identity. Second, we assume each product will have a RFID tag on it self. Third, we assume all of the customer were already login in our webapp and ready for checkout.
